# Valiant
A video game proposal

I proposed to my wafe with a video game.
This engine is built off of Celeste for Pico8 with a few different mechanics.

You can play the game here! https://ghostedbones.github.io/valiant.html

She had to collect +s instead of coins to unlock the treasure chest in each level.
We used + and - instead of hearts or emojis to kind show each other if we liked what the other was doing.
Every level had a different theme, color, and some animated creature with the last proposal at the end

This first level was easy to beat without the boost.

This 2nd level focused on the wall jump, breaking blocks and disappearing platforms.

This game is a lot easier with a controller, and she skipped a lot of the dialogue I wrote for her. -

This was my favorite level, where you had to push my character to get past the spikes.

I didn't have enough memory to animate all the lava, makes me want to remake this game outside of Pico8.

This originally was the hardest level that my friends who playtested kept dying on. 
They said I'd never get married if she couldn't beat this level. It's almost impossible to die on now.

Playing Portal 2 is a fantastic CoOp experience for us to play long distance! 11/10 would recommend.
I also highlighted the push block puzzle because my beta testers got too confused.

Gotta have those moving platforms. Also now my character lifts her up more than just metaphorically.

I started experimenting with costumes on this one. 
She collects a "Space rock" because I gave her a comet piece instead of a diamond ring.
We both really love space.

I never programmed a "no" option, but she could of just not touched the ring. I'd get the message.
Saying "yes" sends my character into a dancing frenzy. (It's not a seizure, that's just how I dance)

After the proposal I took her on a romantic hot air balloon ride.
We are both scared of heights so we were both white knuckling the ropes.
She was afraid of losing the ring too.
